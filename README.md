# Textile Syntax Highlighting for Vim.

Syntax highlighting for textile files in Vim.

## Install

- Easily installed using Vundle.
- Add `Bundle 'svsudhir/textile.vim'` to your `.vimrc.bundles` file.
- Then, `:BundleInstall`.

## Modifications

The original textile.vim syntax file by provided by Tim Harper has been changed to syntax file authored by Kornelius Kalnbach as this syntax file is more comprehensive.

I use textile with Jekyll and Liquid template language. So, some additions have been carried out by me. I have added the following tags to the syntax file.

### Added

- `---`
- `layout:`
- `title:`
- `keywords:`
- `description:`

## Reference

1. redcloth.org
2. jekyllrb.com

### Thanks

Tim Harper for plugin and Kornelius Kalnbach for the syntax file.
