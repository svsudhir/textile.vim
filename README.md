#Textile Syntax Highlighting for Vim.

Syntax highlighting for textile files in Vim.

##Install

- Easily installed using Vundle.
- Add Bundle 'svsudhir/textile.vim' to your .vimrc.bundles file.
- Then, :BundleInstall

##Modifications

The original textile.vim syntax file by provided by Tim Harper has been changed to syntax file authored by Kornelius Kalnbach as this syntax file is more comprehensive.

I use textile with Jekyll and Liquid template language. So, some additions have been carried out by me. I have added the following tags to the syntax file.

###Added

- layout:
- title:
- keywords:
